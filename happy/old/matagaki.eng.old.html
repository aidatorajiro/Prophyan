<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>I won the Newcomer’s Award at the 2018 Japan Media Arts Festival for his work “I’m In The Computer Memory”. In this installation work, visitors explore the white dot projected in the center of the screen as themselves in a black and white gradation projection of the computer memory space. The visitor gets a glimpse of a small universe within the computer that we use everyday. The data stored in a computer can only be understood when it is processed in various ways and appears on the screen (for example, a document), and the data behind it is not easy to understand unless you are an expert. However, if you make it into shapes and colors of black and white gradation, it becomes a shipyard. An abandoned factory. A forest. We get “other meanings”. In this way, the division between machines and humans, between those who know machines and those who don’t, may be eased. We may be able to perceive machines not just as mechanical calculators, but as beings with a very human warmth. That’s what I was aiming for in this work. I made this work thinking that it was a game. This is because one of the purposes of this work is for me to enter the world of the computer and go on a “sightseeing” or “adventure”. In a way, it’s like envisioning another version of myself.</p>
<p>I have tried and failed many times. The design of a trail of footprints created by the player (white dot). I designed it so that the change in position and velocity would project the “atan” function, and then adjusted the parameters slightly to make it move in the most “comfortable” way. What I want to say is that this work looks very simple and minimalistic, but in fact it is built on a lot of arbitrariness.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects, it was developed using three.js, a JavaScript library that can draw WebGL, and Erectron, a software that can develop JavaScript desktop applications. In fact, this application was originally developed using Python, not JavaScript. I exhibited it as a “game” at a high school festival, but as I recall, it did not work well, so I re-created it.</p>

<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>
<p>It is a sequel to “I’m In The Computer Memory”, or rather, a work that overlaps quite a bit in concept. This work was exhibited at the Media Ambition Tokyo exhibition in February-March 2020. First of all, let’s read the caption that was used for the exhibition.</p>
<pre><code>Type some text to the computer. Then press a button. Wow! Many words appears! Move the mouse quickly to choose a word. Selected words are combined and made into a sentence. The original text and the combined text have the same consonants. You can help your words to get their consonant-friends! There are many things in this world, and everything is connected to another thing somewhere. The relationships are hidden, however, we can reveal them. A world that you couldn’t see, but is actually exists. An another aspect of yourself. The world is not fixed. You can go to any worlds if you change the perspective. I want to feel like that. You can just enjoy what happened in your mind is changing. Of course, you can type some English text at first. Then the computer interprets the text as hiragana!</code></pre>
<p>Thus, in a nutshell, it is a game where you can “enjoy the way words are transformed in various ways by the connections of consonants.”I’m In The Computer Memory" was an exploration of what goes on behind the scenes of a computer processing data. How about this one? Words work as if to support the unchangeable reality and the feeling of “it wasn’t supposed to be like this”. However, I created this work to show that it is possible to reverse this effect and change the reality. If we can catch a glimpse of “the world that could have been”, the sense of stagnation in our current reality may be eased a little.</p>

<p>2015年 東京都現代美術館,「おとなもこどもも考える ここはだれの場所?」</p>
<p>In 2015, as a member of the family art unit “Aida Family”, I exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo in the exhibition “An Art Exhibition for Children Whose place is this?”. The exhibition included “檄文” (created by the whole family), which raises the issue of the Japanese education system, many drawings that I made, “TANTATAN”, a video work that I directed when I was in elementary school, and “Sekai no Kao” (created with Mitsuho Yamamoto and Hideki Tanaka), an installation which introduces the faces and emotions of people around the world.</p>

<h2 id="mitou-asobi-project-achievement-report">MITOU ASOBI Project Achievement Report</h2>
<p>2018</p>
<p>I participated in a software engineer education project led by Japanese goverment, called MITOU. There I created a software relating to blockchain. The aim of the software is that you can experience the blockchain in your browser through sound and sight, and experience processing data as if you were a part of a blockchain program. By becoming a part of the programs that make up the blockchain, it become easier to understand its structure. However, I don’t really remember much about it because I wasn’t really comfortable with, how to say, the mood of a science research institute or the bureaucratic atmosphere. In particular, having to write a “daily report” every day was chipping away at my “productivity”, and it was like the problem with the Japanese education system that I had pointed out in my “檄文” earlier. In spite of all this, I succeeded in writing a 35-page long paper on the integration of art and software technology, along with my own drawings, for the final “Achievement Report” to be submitted. Here is a part of it.</p>

<p>After entering university, I was inspired by using Google Maps to find my way to school, and I thought it would be interesting to have a Google Map that imagined roads and buildings on the moon. I used AI to “forcibly” extract data such as road surfaces and buildings from photos of the moon. These kind of “forcibleness” may be one of the main themes in my work.</p>

<p>This is a project to create a site similar to “an old Internet site with no clear purpose” or “a game using only HTML and CSS, where you click on links to explore the world” using a functional language called Haskell. An example of the latter site is the “Adventure Game Online ‘Labyrinth’” (<a href="http://hwm7.gyao.ne.jp/ex328/stage/history.html" class="uri">http://hwm7.gyao.ne.jp/ex328/stage/history.html</a>), which was updated from 1999 to 2007. Compared to programming languages such as JavaScript, C, Python, etc., functional languages have a “mathematical” way of thinking (e.g., the meaning of “=” is not “assignment” but “definition”), which gives them a unique divinity. It is a work that combines my romantic (?) yearning for such technology with my feelings about the Internet culture of the past, especially when I was in elementary school. It is still under development, and the contents are being added slowly and gradually.</p>

<p>There is a software called Wine. It allows you to run Windows applications on Mac OS and Linux, but the way to run it is a little special (comparing to so-called “Emulators”). An important function of the OS is system calls, which allow you to read and write files, communicate, and/or perform other computer operations. In general, system calls are grouped into dynamic libraries, so computer operations are executed in the following way: application-&gt;dynamic library-&gt;system call-&gt;OS. Wine “replaces” this dynamic library so that Windows applications can run on other operating systems. Then, here is a point: What would happen if an EXE file (Windows application) directly invokes system calls of MacOS without going through the dynamic library? In this experiment, I synthesized something like chimera of Windows and MacOS application. I find it aesthetically pleasing when something that was once created for one purpose is transformed into something else. This work embodies such aesthetics.</p>

<p>A software that automatically generates magic circles.</p>
<p>The rules for generating this magic circle are based on a generalization of the pentagram or hexagram, or more mathematically, an n-m-pointed star. An n-m-pointed star is a figure that is drawn by skipping m points and connecting lines based on an n-square. Personally, I like the 7-3-pointed star (<code>Z(7, 3)</code>). I feel power of sin and cos. By the way, many of the avatar images I create on the Internet are based on images generated by this service and processed in various ways.</p>
