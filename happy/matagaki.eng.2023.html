<p>2021 - Exhibited at “Media Ambition Tokyo” (group exhibition), Tokyo
City View, Roppongi Hills Building</p>
<p><em>Ero Law Search</em> is an installation artwork that consists of a
vertical display, a controller mat, and a computer. Some part of
Japanese Law is shown on the display, overlapped by automatically
generated drawings, which consist of colorful curving shapes and emojis
with mathematical symbols. You can put your feet on the mat to control
the computer and view another part of the law. The mat was put on the
market roughly 20 years ago by a famous game company in Japan. The title
is named after “E-gov Law Search”, a Japanese governmental website that
publishes all of the law, and Eros as the human desire towards goodness
or beautifulness. </p>
<p>The aim of this artwork is to ease the oppressiveness of the law,
which is normally visible through black ink on white paper, like a white
cube exhibition chamber. <em>Ero Law Search</em> introduces a new way to
see the law, by drawing colorful shapes on it. Similarly, Emoji is
itself and based on typography, which defines “the normal person”
through “the normal language”. The aim of <em>Ero Law Search</em> is to
destroy norms by using these oppressive objects.</p>
<p>The law is the dictionary of all social problems, as it is designed
to solve or ease these problems. Through <em>Ero Law Search</em>,
visitors can feel, think and imagine about these problems, like reading
a dictionary randomly, without any purpose.</p>
<p>As such, <em>Ero Law Search</em> is not something that impose the
norm of the law. Rather, I want to emphasize the feeling of flying
freely around the universe of colors, shapes, and texts, which is
similar to the concept of 遊 of Daoism.</p>
<p>Verse 73 of 道徳経 (an old scripture of Daoism) is shown on the
display. The verse criticizes the law, as it is formed and controlled
arbitrarily by humans. Rather than relative concepts such as the law,
Daoists value 天 (Heaven) and 道 (Dao), which are absolute concepts that
generate and coordinate everything in the universe. Even if people don’t
rely on the law, 天 and 道 coordinate everything towards good. On the
contrary, as the law is arbitrary, it may harm good, like “if you’re not
a lumberjack but cut wood then you must injure yourself” (verse 72). I
present Verse 73 because it moves me and want to share my emotion with
visitors.</p>

<p>It is a work that overlaps quite a bit in concept with “I’m In The
Computer Memory”. It was exhibited at the Media Ambition Tokyo
exhibition in February-March 2020.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it is a game where you can enjoy the way words are
transformed depending on the connections of consonants. The system is
inspired by Hebrew and Arabic language, in which words may be written
only by consonants.</p>
<p>Words work as if to support the unchangeable reality. I created this
work to show that it is possible to reverse this effect and change the
reality through transforming words and realizing hidden networks behind
them. If we can catch a glimpse of “the world (or words) that could have
been”, the sense of stagnation in our current reality may be eased a
little.</p>
<p>To be more specific, after the visitor types some text, the computer
starts to select words with the same sequence of consonants. The visitor
can interfere in the selection by moving the mouse. During the selection
process, words are spoken by the computer (via auto-speech system of the
OS). After sufficient words are selected to construct a new
consonent-friend sentence, the whole passage is read again in two ways:
in accordance with the original consonants (which is typed by the
visitor) and re-interpretation of generated text by auto-speech AI.
Because Japanese has many forms (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana, Alphabet,
etc.), a sentence can be read infinitely different ways. The auto-speech
AI guesses the most probable way of reading (although sometimes they
speak in “wrong way”), however it may not include original consonants.
Therefore I make it to read in two ways.</p>

<p>Inspired from the experience of using Google Map to find my way to
school shortly after entering the university, I made a Google Map-like
website that imagines roads and buildings on the moon.</p>
<p>I used AI to “forcibly” extract data such as road surfaces and
buildings from photos of the moon. Imaginary moon buildings and roads
are shown in the app, by making an aerial photograph recognition AI to
recognize the surface image of moon as the image of Earth city. The AI
is programmed only to calculate which part of the image is “likely” to
be building or roads, therefore even if you put the moon image on it, it
will tell you its own opinion anyway. Using that data, I made a Google
Map-like application in which you can find shortest path from one place
to another. For buildings, autogenerated names based on coordinates are
assigned.</p>
<p>This work is made during NASA Space Apps Challenge Hackathon.</p>

<p>It is an application and installation work. In the exhibition space,
there is a large screen and a touchscreen. Small grey squares are
arranged on the screen. These squares represent the data stored in the
computer, most of which is invisible when you normally use computers. A
small white dot is placed at the center of the screen. This represents
yourself, making you feel inside the small universe within a
computer.</p>
<p>Through exploring the inner space of a computer, you may link the
grayscale pattern of data with your own life experience. Although the
data behind the scene is not easy to “properly” understand unless you
are an expert, with these data transformed into shapes and colors, it
may become a shipyard, an abandoned factory, or a forest. We may obtain
“other meanings”, or “improper way of understanding”. In this way, the
division between machines and humans, between those who know machines
and those who don’t, may be eased. We may be able to perceive machines
not just as mechanical calculators, but as beings with a very human
warmth. That’s what I was aiming for in this work. I made this work
thinking that it was a game. This is because one of the purposes of this
work is for me to enter the world of the computer and go on a
“sightseeing” or “adventure”. In a way, it’s like envisioning another
version of myself.</p>
<p>You may see this work looks very simple and minimalistic, but in
reality I have tried and failed many times, and it is built on a lot of
arbitrariness. For example, I designed a trail of footprints created by
the player (white dot), so that the change in position and velocity
would project the “atan” function, and then adjusted the parameters
slightly to make it move in the most “comfortable” way.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects, it was developed using three.js, a
JavaScript library that can draw WebGL, and Erectron, a software that
can develop JavaScript desktop applications. In fact, this application
was originally developed using Python, not JavaScript. I exhibited it as
a “game” at an art festival during my high school days, but it did not
work well, so I re-created it using JavaScript.</p>

<p>It is a project to create a website similar to “an old Internet
website with no clear purpose” or “a game using only HTML and CSS, where
you click on links to explore the world” using a functional language,
Haskell. An example of such website is the “Adventure Game Online
‘Labyrinth’” (<a href="http://hwm7.gyao.ne.jp/ex328/stage/history.html"
class="uri">http://hwm7.gyao.ne.jp/ex328/stage/history.html</a>), which
was updated from 1999 to 2007.</p>
<p>Compared to programming languages such as JavaScript, C, Python,
etc., functional languages have a “mathematical” way of thinking (e.g.,
the meaning of “=” is not “assignment” but “definition”), which gives
them a unique divinity. It is a work that combines my romantic yearning
of Functional Programming technology and the Internet culture of the
past, especially when I was 10 years old or so. It is still under
development, and the contents are being added slowly and gradually.</p>
<p>Visitors use keyboard and mouse to play it. Many algorithms, shapes,
pictures that I found interesting are combined into one app. For
example, it contains an algorithm that simulates waves based on physics
knowledge, or a blurred picture of a 404 page I took from somewhere on
the internet, and so on…</p>
