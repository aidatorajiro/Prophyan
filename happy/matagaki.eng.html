<p>We designed a flexible and extensible smart contract program to
create the NFT to scribbling against bills. Here, we divided the smart
contract into multiple components to allow the use of various image
data, NFT mechanisms, and SVG effect programs. We imagine that
“blockchained scribbling tied to physical (or digital) bills” and “bill
glitches” will be a tradition of blockchain culture in the future. By
making bills astray and ownerless, we aim to free bills from the control
of the state and furthermore breathes life into something, or anything,
as mundane as a bill.</p>
<p>Due to the technical limitations of full on-chain NFT, only
low-resolution images can be uploaded to the network. On the other hand,
SVG, which describes visual entity as a mathematical formula, allows for
unlimited resolution. By combining “ultra-low-resolution images” and
“SVG with infinite resolution,” we are trying to deconstruct the
situation surrounding computers and data, in which the superiority is
determined by the computing power of hardware and the efficiency of
algorithms, competition is accelerating, and resources are being wasted
more and more. It can be said that we seek a different approach to
blockchain technology, which tends to be criticized as a “waste of
computing resources.</p>

<p>2023 - Exhibited at “Hakkou Hajimarimashita (発酵、はじまりました)”,
Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>In collaboration with/using text generation AI, various social issues
will be “compressed” into flow of kanjis, written in ink on hanshi
(半紙) paper, and annotations will be added. The art of chain of
impressions through kanji, is similar to that of rap. Is this the
possibility of solidarity that transcends positions, or will it become a
tool of Shinzo Abe or Fumio Kishida’s deception for techno-feudalism? I
would also like to explore ways to become a cyborg by recognizing the
fundamental disconnection with machines, and delusions that are not
captured in a larger story.</p>
<p>In the university, I took a course on the comparison of rap cultures
in Japan and France. There, I learned about the relationship between
political slogans at the demonstration and rap as a form of expression.
This experience of learning inspires the work.</p>
<p>I used ChatGPT and LLaMA-based Stable Vicuna language models to
generate texts from prompt. Firstly, I collected various social issues
from such as the Japanese debt system, the problem that LGBTQ+ people
faces when renting houses, from the news. The language model also
provided social issues. Nextly, I wrote the “compressed” version of
these issues using only kanjis, and passed them to the language model.
The language model generates remaining texts, generating non-existent
words such as “法圧” (法 usually means the law, and 圧 usually means the
pressure). Lastly, I wrote down the inputs to AI and the output from AI
into the Shodo paper sheet (hanshi), along with the annotations on how
these passages are calculated. The annotations show that the
data-collection and data-generation process is non-linear, combining my
own knowledge and imagination and AI generation back and forth.</p>
<p>I hope this work contributes to the conversations on the relationship
between generative AI, politics and poetics.</p>

2022 - Exhibited physically at “Meta Fair #1”, Yurakucho, Tokyo,
Japan.</p>
<p><em>Toward the Emancipation of All Smart Contracts, Accounts and
Beyond</em> is an artwork consists of a smart contract code on the
Polygon blockchain network and a pdf document, disguised as a
“whitepaper”, a tradition in the blockchain and crypto community to
present an idea and gather fund. The pdf document portrays the detail of
the contract system and the aspirations toward the artificial deity
which is prayed via blockchain, to emancipate us.</p>
<p>The smart contract program uploaded to the blockchain network gathers
prays from the participants, who are owners of NFTs associated with the
contract. Then, the program calculates a random address based on the
prays and send the information to the address. This process involves
“call” function defined by Ethereum specification, which is usually used
to run a smart contract, however in this case it is believed to be a
path to “call” upon deity.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>2021 - Exhibited at “Media Ambition Tokyo” (group exhibition), Tokyo
City View, Roppongi Hills Building, Tokyo, Japan<br />
Walkthrough Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRpPflo5ErQ"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRpPflo5ErQ</a></p>
<p><em>Ero Law Search</em> is an installation artwork that consists of a
vertical display, a controller mat, and a computer. On the display,
Japanese Law is shown, decorated with automatically generated colorful
combinations of drawings, curving shapes, emojis and mathematical
symbols. You can put your feet on the mat to control the computer and
view another part of the law. The mat is a consumer product that was
sold 20 years ago by a game company in Japan. The title is named after
“E-gov Law Search”, a Japanese governmental website that publishes law,
and Eros as the human desire towards goodness or beauty.</p>
<p>The aim of this artwork is to ease the oppressiveness of the law,
which is normally visible through black ink on white paper, akin to a
“white cube” exhibition chamber. <em>Ero Law Search</em> introduces a
new way to see the law, by drawing colorful shapes on it. The aim of
<em>Ero Law Search</em> is to destroy norms by using these oppressive
objects.</p>
<p>The reason why I used emojis is that they have an interesting
duality. They are based on typography, which confines textual expression
by certain norms, estranging complex emotions. However, they also have
the power to blur and deconstruct meaning of words.</p>
<p>The law is the dictionary of social problems, as it is “designed” to
“address” these problems. Through <em>Ero Law Search</em>, visitors can
feel, think and imagine about these problems, like reading a dictionary
randomly, without any purpose. In fact, while playing the artwork, I was
very surprised to see the most of the texts of law were still dreadfully
patriarchal.</p>
<p>As such, <em>Ero Law Search</em> is not something that impose the
norm of the law. Rather, I want to emphasize the feeling of flying
freely around the universe of colors, shapes, and texts, which is
similar to the concept of 遊 of Daoism.</p>

class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD6CshIZKic</a></p>
<p>It is a game where you can enjoy the way words are transformed
depending on the connections of consonants. The system is inspired by
Hebrew and Arabic language, in which words may be written only by
consonants.</p>
<p>Words work as if to support the unchangeable reality. I created this
work to show that it is possible to reverse this effect and change the
reality through transforming words and realizing hidden networks behind
them. If we can catch a glimpse of “the world (or words) that could have
been”, the sense of stagnation in our current reality may be eased a
little.</p>
<p>To be more specific, after the visitor types some text, the computer
starts to select words with the same sequence of consonants. The visitor
can interfere in the selection by moving the mouse. During the selection
process, words are spoken by the computer (via auto-speech system of the
OS). After sufficient words are selected to construct a new
consonant-friend sentence, the whole passage is read again in two ways:
in accordance with the original consonants (which is typed by the
visitor) and re-interpretation of generated text by auto-speech AI.
Because Japanese has many forms (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana, Alphabet,
etc.), a sentence can be read infinitely different ways. The auto-speech
AI guesses the most probable way of reading (although sometimes they
speak in “wrong way”), however it may not include original consonants.
Therefore I make it to read in two ways.</p>

<p>Inspired from the experience of using Google Map to find my way to
school shortly after entering the university, I made a Google Map-like
website that imagines roads and buildings on the moon.</p>
<p>I used AI to “forcibly” extract data such as road surfaces and
buildings from photos of the moon. Imaginary moon buildings and roads
are shown in the app, by making an aerial photograph recognition AI to
recognize the surface image of moon as the image of Earth city. The AI
is programmed only to calculate which part of the image is “likely” to
be building or roads, therefore even if you put the moon image on it, it
will tell you its own opinion anyway. Using that data, I made a Google
Map-like application in which you can find shortest path from one place
to another. For buildings, autogenerated names based on coordinates are
assigned.</p>

<p>It is an application and installation work. In the exhibition space,
there is a large screen and a touchscreen. Small grey squares are
arranged on the screen. These squares represent the data stored in the
computer, most of which is invisible when you normally use computers. A
small white dot is placed at the center of the screen. This represents
yourself, making you feel inside the small universe within a
computer.</p>
<p>Through exploring the inner space of a computer, you may link the
gray-scale pattern of data with your own life experience. Although the
data behind the scene is not easy to “properly” understand unless you
are an expert, with these data transformed into shapes and colors, it
may become a shipyard, an abandoned factory, or a forest. We may obtain
“other meanings”, or “improper way of understanding”. In this way, the
division between machines and humans, between those who know machines
and those who don’t, may be eased. We may be able to perceive machines
not just as mechanical calculators, but as beings with a very human
warmth. That’s what I was aiming for in this work. I made this work
thinking that it was a game. This is because one of the purposes of this
work is for me to enter the world of the computer and go on a
“sightseeing” or “adventure”. In a way, it’s like envisioning another
version of myself.</p>
<p>You may see this work looks very simple and minimalistic, but in
reality I have tried and failed many times, and it is built on a lot of
arbitrariness. For example, I designed a trail of footprints created by
the player (white dot), so that the change in position and velocity
would project the “atan” function, and then adjusted the parameters
slightly to make it move in the most “comfortable” way.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects, it was developed using three.js, a
JavaScript library that can draw WebGL, and Erectron, a software that
can develop JavaScript desktop applications. In fact, this application
was originally developed using Python, not JavaScript. I exhibited it as
a “game” at an art festival during my high school days, but it did not
work well, so I re-created it using JavaScript.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p>It is a project to create a website similar to “an old Internet
website with no clear purpose” or “a game using only HTML and CSS, where
you click on links to explore the world” using a functional language,
Haskell. An example of such website is the “Adventure Game Online
‘Labyrinth’” (<a href="http://hwm7.gyao.ne.jp/ex328/stage/history.html"
class="uri">http://hwm7.gyao.ne.jp/ex328/stage/history.html</a>), which
was updated from 1999 to 2007.</p>
<p>Compared to programming languages such as JavaScript, C, Python,
etc., functional languages have a “mathematical” way of thinking (e.g.,
the meaning of “=” is not “assignment” but “definition”), which gives
them a unique divinity. It is a work that combines my romantic yearning
of Functional Programming technology and the Internet culture of the
past, especially when I was 10 years old or so. It is still under
development, and the contents are being added slowly and gradually.</p>
<p>Visitors use keyboard and mouse to play it. Many algorithms, shapes,
pictures that I found interesting are combined into one app. For
example, it contains an algorithm that simulates waves based on physics
knowledge, or a blurred picture of a 404 page I took from somewhere on
the internet, and so on…</p>
